								Looking for sponsors to add a capability to run Cryo-EM experiments in <a href="./crystaline">Crystaline</a>:
							</p>
							<ol class="business-model__list">
								<li>Design the experiment: set up conditions, labware</li>
								<li>Execute the experiment: document the steps, generate sample IDs, submit for analysis</li>
								<li>Track the results</li>
								<li>Mine data</li>
						  </ol>
							<p>We build high-quality, user-friendly apps. If you want to get a taste of how the end result will
								look, you can check out <a href="./crystaline">Crystaline</a> which already covers Crystallography
								workflows.</p>
							<p>If you're interested in sponsoring or want to be notified about the progress,
								let us know at <a href="mailto:support@elsci.io">support@elsci.io</a>.
								Here's our <a href="./business-model.html">Business Model</a>. By sponsoring this product you will
								get access to the Crystallography part as well, and maybe to other products and capabilities that we
								build.
