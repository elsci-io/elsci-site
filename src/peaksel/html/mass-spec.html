			<h1>Mass Spectrometry: types, modes, data processing</h1>
			<div id="toc"></div>
			<h2>Components of Mass Spectrometers</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Mass Analyzer</b> - the part which separates/sorts the ions. This
				determines the type of mass spectrometer e.g. Quadrupoles,
				Time-of-Flights, Orbitraps - they all differ in mass analyzers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Ion Source</b> is responsible for ionizing the analytes. The most
				used ion source in mass spectrometry is ESI (electro-spray ionization).
				Some of the sources are used only with specific Mass Analyzers: for
				instance MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) is specific
				to <a href="#tof">TOF</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Detector</b> is the part that senses the ions that were passed by
				Mass Analyzer. Some of the detectors are coupled with Mass Analyzers -
				e.g. Orbitrap is both a Mass Analyzer and a Detector. Note Mass
				Spectrometer itself may also be called a "detector" when considered as a
				whole.

			<h2>Mass Analyzers</h2>

			<h3 id="quad">Quadrupoles, SQD</h3>
			<p>
				Quadrupoles (Single Quadrupole Detector in particular) are
				low-resolution mass analyzers. There are 2 sets of rods: one pair is on
				horizontal and one pair - on vertical axis. Voltages is applied to both
				pairs. It changes with different frequency so that one of the axes
				resonates with ions of m/z bigger than the one we're interested in, the
				other axis filters out ions of smaller m/z. Thus only the ions of the
				right m/z are passed through, while the rest are filtered out:
			</p>
			<img src="mass-spec-quads.png" style="max-width: 25em; float: right" />
			<p>
				When in <a href="#scanmode">Scan mode</a> - the m/z of interest changes
				gradually from lower to the upper boundary, measuring this way different
				ions at different time. When in <a href="#sim">SIM mode</a> - only one
				m/z is passed and the rest of them are filtered out; though it's
				possible to set up quadrupoles to switch between multiple specific
				masses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Quadrupole can also work in so called RF-only mode (RF - radio
				frequency). In this case it doesn't filter out any ions - all of the
				masses are passed through. This may be useful if quadrupole is used for
				other purposes than analyzing masses: e.g. as a collision cell or an as
				an interface before other mass analyzers.
			</p>

			<h3 id="tof">TOF (Time-of-Flight)</h3>
			<p>
				TOF is a particle accelerator which then measures how quickly the
				analytes reach the detector. Small ions reach the detector faster than
				the big ions. By measuring time of arrival we can tell the mass of the
				arrived particle. TOF is considered a High Resolution Mass Spectrometer
				(HRMS) - it can tell apart ions with very small differences in mass
				compared to Quadrupoles.
			</p>
			<img src="mass-spec-tof.png" style="border: none" />
			<p>
				Because TOF is an HRMS it requires special care to designing its parts.
				In rest state ions don't actually stay still - they move around with
				different velocity according to
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution"
					>Boltzmann distribution</a
				>. Because of how sensitive TOF is - these initial differences in ions
				will have an impact on the eventual mass resolution:
			</p>
			<img src="mass-spec-tof-ionpulser.png" style="max-width: 200px" />
			<p>
				This puts constraints on how ion source is designed - you can't just
				trap ions after ESI because they will have large differences in initial
				kinetic energy. For these reasons other types of ionization is used.
			</p>
			<h4>MALDI</h4>
			<p>
				MALDI represents a plate with dried down sample - the laser is used to
				ionize the analytes in this case. This, along with
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_extraction"
					>Delayed Extraction</a
				>
				keeps the ions close together and improves the resolution of the
				instrument. Such combination of components is called MALDI-TOF or MTOF.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nice thing about MALDI is it allows for High-Throughput Analysis -
				several seconds is enough to analyze hundreds of samples. But the
				drawbacks - it's not compatible with chromatography. So in the end you
				end up with just 1 spectrum instead of a chromatogram. This makes it
				impractical for most samples in pharma as this leads to ion suppression
				- which decreases sensitivity of the instrument.
			</p>

			<h4>oa-TOF</h4>
			<p>
				Orthogonal Acceleration TOF allows more diverse ion sources. E.g. in
				case of a hybrid of like Quadrupole-TOF (QTOF) this enables combining
				chromatography with TOF. In this scenario Quadrupole ensures the ions
				are focused in space. Then they get introduced in TOF ion accelerator,
				reflected via orthogonal accelerator and then continue as usual TOF:
			</p>
			<img src="mass-spec-qtof.png" style="border: none" />

			<h2 id="tandem">MS/MS, MS<sup>2</sup>, MS<sup>n</sup></h2>
			<p>
				Tandem MS means there are more than 1 mass analyzer separated either in
				space (there are 2+ physical devices) or separated in time (analytes go
				in circles and are processed by the same set of devices multiple times).
			</p>

			<h3>QqQ - Triple Quadrupole MS</h3>
			<p>
				This is a type of Tandem MS which has 2 quadrupole mass analyzers and
				yet another quadrupole in between which passes all ions through:
			</p>
			<img src="mass-spec-quads-tripple.png" style="border: none" />

			<h2>Modes of Mass Spectrometers</h2>
			<h3 id="scanmode">Scan Mode</h3>
			<p>
				Determines the presence of analytes in the range of m/z. E.g. we could
				scan from 100m/z to 1000m/z - all ions in this range will be determine.
				Some mass analyzers like quadrupoles will sequentially look for 100m/z,
				then go to 101m/z and so on till the end of range. Of course the
				granularity of the scan will be specific to a particular instrument and
				its settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				This mode is used when we need qualitative information about our sample
				- which m/z are present. It could also be used for quantitative
				experiments, but because it dwells on a single m/z for a very short
				period of time it's not as sensitive as <a href="#sim">SIM</a> mode.
			</p>

			<h3 id="sim">SIM - Single Ion Monitoring</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike <a href="#scanmode">Scan Mode</a> when scientists set up Mass
				Spectrometer in SIM mode they already know which m/z to look for. The
				instrument will look for the specified m/z instead scanning through all
				possible values - this allows the detector to dwell on configured m/z
				longer, reducing signal-to-noise ratio and allowing for better
				quantification.
			</p>

			<h3>Tandem MS modes</h3>
			<p>
				Most of the workflows use 2 mass analyzers and a collision cell in
				between. Mass analyzers could work either in SIM or in Scan modes
				depending on the specific need. Ions flowing out of the 1st Mass
				Analyzer are called Precursors (aka parent ion). Fragment ions coming
				out of the collision cell are called Product Ions (aka daughter ion).
			</p>
			<p id="cid">
				Collision Cell is used for Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) - in
				order to fragment the ions. This is important because it allows to
				receive a qualitative information about the precursor (whether it's
				actually our ion or something else with similar m/z), or to distinguish
				2 isobaric precursors during quantification.
			</p>

			<h4 id="productscan">Product Ion Scan</h4>
			<p>
				Is about analyzing the fragmentation patterns of the selected precursor
				ion. Often is done before going to <a href="#srm">SRM</a> to understand
				which of the fragments are possible, how they differ from fragments of
				other precursors and which fragment gives the highest signal intensity
				(for further quantification).
			</p>
			<img src="mass-spec-productscan.png" style="border: none" />
			<p>
				Since 2nd mass analyzer works in <a href="#scanmode">Scan Mode</a> we
				get a whole spectrum of m/z every N millisec, but for each of the
				spectrum we also record the precursor m/z.
			</p>

			<h4 id="srm">SRM - Selected Reaction Monitoring</h4>
			<p>
				Also known as MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) - a mode when both of
				the mass analyzers work in SIM mode. Important for quantification of an
				analyte in a complex mixture. The 1st detector needs to be in SIM mode
				because multiple different precursors could potentially be dissociated
				into same fragments. Also there could be isobaric species either in the
				original mixture or in the fragments from different precursors.
			</p>
			<img src="mass-spec-srm.png" style="border: none" />

			<h4>Data-dependent acquisition (DDA)</h4>
			<p>
				Before selecting ion transitions for SRM we need to determine the
				precursor ions and the fragments they are split into. It's possible to
				first run a Scan, then for each of the ion we're interested in, we can
				run additional Product Ion Scan. But this is very time consuming. DDA
				solves this problem by allowing you to run a typical SQD Scan Mode and
				once high intensities of m/z are detected - automatically switch into
				another mode (e.g. Product Ion Scan).
			</p>
			<p>
				This allows for a much faster method development. E.g. if you're looking
				for 3 precursors - you'd have to run a Scan Mode and 3 Product Ion Scans
				to gather all the necessary information for the future SRMs. With DDA
				it's just a single run. Once a high level of signal is reached - the
				instrument will check all high m/z's detected.
			</p>

			<h2>Types of chromatograms in Peaksel</h2>
			<p>
				Peaksel uses prefixes to differentiate between different types of
				detector modes and chromatograms. Full chromatogram name consists of
				<code>DETECTOR-IONIZATION-CHROMATOGRAM</code> sequence.
			</p>
			<h3>Detector prefixes</h3>

					<a href="#productscan">Product Ion Scan</a> where 1st analyzer is a
					<a href="#quad">Quadrupole</a> and the last one is
					<a href="#tof">TOF</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Ionization</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><code>ES+</code> or <code>ES-</code> - Electro-Spray Ionization</li>
				<li><code>CI+</code> or <code>CI-</code> - Chemical Ionization</li>

					mass analyzer is in a <a href="#scanmode">Scan Mode</a>.
				</li>
				<li>

					chromatogram, but only intensities of selected m/z are used to build
					the trace.
				</li>
				<li>
