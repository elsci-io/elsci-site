        <h1>Focused Gradients: generating Sample Lists</h1>
        <p>
          So you want to generate your Sample Lists/Sequences from scouting runs on a regular basis? Let's see
          how you can set up Peaksel to generate those with couple of clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Prerequisites:</i> you've developed methods with zoned Focused Gradients, you've got your scouting
          results. What's left is to select the right zone for each sample based on the Retention Time of the target
          peaks.
        </p>
				<h2>Sample List table</h2>
        <p>First you can create a table that resembles the one that you want to upload to your software that
          controls the instrument. You can name your columns, add calculated columns however you want. So suppose
          you want something like this for MassLynx:</p>
        <table class="sheet">
          <thead>
          <tr>
            <th class="sheet__cell sheet__cell--header">File Name</th>
            <th class="sheet__cell sheet__cell--header">Sample ID</th>
            <th class="sheet__cell sheet__cell--header">MS File</th>
            <th class="sheet__cell sheet__cell--header">Bottle</th>
            <th class="sheet__cell sheet__cell--header">Injection Volume</th>
            <th class="sheet__cell sheet__cell--header">Inlet Method</th>
            <th class="sheet__cell sheet__cell--header">Scouting RT</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="sheet__cell">0000-001-prep1</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">0000-001-prep1</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">ES+MSMethod</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">D:5</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">5.0</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell"><b>5minGradient4</b></td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">1.82</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="sheet__cell">0000-002-prep1</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">0000-002-prep1</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">ES+MSMethod</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">D:6</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">5.0</td>
            <td class="sheet__cell"><b>5minGradient1</b></td>
            <td class="sheet__cell">0.35</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The last column is the most important - it's the method with the zone that we calculated. So what do formulas look like?</p>
				<h2>Focused Gradients formula</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="bullet">"File Name" and "Sample ID" are easy - just peak predefined "Injection name" column from
            what Peaksel suggest, and then replace the formula with <code>injection.name + '-prep1'</code></li>
          <li class="bullet">"Bottle" is one of the predefined columns, aka "Plate Location"</li>
          <li class="bullet">"MS File" and "Injection Volume" are just static strings, when adding a Calculated
            Column just put <code>'ES+MSMethod'</code> and <code>5.0</code> respectively.</li>
          <li>"Scouting RT" - this is the Retention Time of our analyte that we want to purify. From the list of
            predefined columns select the peak that you want to purify, and rename the column to "Scouting RT"
            respectively.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Finally "Inlet Method" uses a boolean expression of form:
            <code>expression ? what if true : what if false</code>. In our case it's a series of such blocks:
            <pre class="code">

              col['Scouting RT']   == '' ? 'N/A'
              : col['Scouting RT'] < 0.5 ? '5minGradient1'
              : col['Scouting RT'] < 1.0 ? '5minGradient2'
              : col['Scouting RT'] < 1.5 ? '5minGradient3'
              :                            '5minGradient4'
            </pre></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Filtering out samples w/o peaks</h2>
        <p>If there are samples that don't really have the analyte, you'll see a bunch of 'N/A'. You can filter
          out by going to the table menu, choosing "Filter menu" and specifying the filtering formula.</p>
        <p>The formula is simple - we want only those rows with non-empty "Scouting RT" to stay, so it's just <code>col['Scouting RT']</code></p>


        <h2>Creating a template</h2>
        <p>Now this Batch that you configured can be used as a template. Just go to another batch, select
          <code>Visualize -> Import visualizations</code> and find the template batch.</p>
        <p>Note however, that if the substance was named differently than what you had in the Template Batch,
          you'll have to delete the column "Scouting RT" and creating again - but this time from the substance
          that's actually present.</p>
        <p>Here's the final result that you should get:</p>
