						<p>
							While it's possible to just
							<a href="./import-manual-upload.html"
								>drag'n'drop raw files into Peaksel</a
							>, most organizations will benefit from setting up automatic
							import. This way your administrator can set up all the locations
							and the scientists will never have to deal with raw files and
							folders - everything is going to be manageable using Peaksel
							interface. The process looks like this:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Specify locations where instruments write raw data</li>
							<li>Peaksel looks for the new raw files every several minutes</li>
							<li>
								Once discovered, the data is automatically loaded and processed
							</li>
							<li>
								When scientists open Peaksel, they see the new data and don't
								have to deal with files and folders
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2 class="page-subtitle">Configuring vendor folders</h2>
						<p>Peaksel is able to import the data located:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>In a Windows shared folder (SMB)</li>
							<li>
								At FTP server. Could be yours or an open database like
								<a href="https://massive.ucsd.edu">MassIVE</a>.
							</li>
							<li>On the local disk where Peaksel is running</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							For this you open <code>Settings -> Import</code> and press
							<code>Add location</code>:
						</p>
						<img
							src="../img/import-automatic-location.png"
							alt="a list of locations to import raw analytical data from" />
						<p class="page-paragraph--margin">
							After that you'll need to enter the actual location and possibly
							the credentials to access the raw vendor files:
						</p>
						<img
							src="../img/import-automatic-location-dialog.png"
							alt="location and possibly the credentials to access the raw vendor files" />
						<p>
							Then just turn on the importing and it will discover the files.
							You can add as many of these locations as needed. And you can turn
							on and off them at any point in time.
