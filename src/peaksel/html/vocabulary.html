				Some of the terminology that Peaksel uses differs from the terminology
				in other CDS - usually the intent is to make it more precise or more
				generic to cover a broader set of instruments. Use Ctrl+F or Cmd+F to
				search for terms on this page.

			<h1>Peaksel Vocabulary and Abbreviations</h1>
			<p>
				<b>Base</b> - the most abundant spectrum value (on the X axis) at
				specific RT or within a peak. In terms of Mass Spectrometry it's usually
				called <i>Base Peak Mass</i> (<i>BPM</i>) - the prevailing m/z. In terms
				of UV/IR/Vis detectors it's the wavelength of maximum absorbance.
			</p>
			<p id="rt">
				<b>RT</b> - Retention Time, an X point on a chromatogram. Usually
				measured in minutes. Peak RT is the time of its highest point.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Batch</b> - a set of instrument
				<a href="#injection">injections</a> grouped together. Usually they
				represent 1 logical experiment.
			</p>
			<p id="dad">
				<b>DAD</b> (Diode Array Detection) or <b>PDA</b> (Photodiode-Array
				Detection) - a type of detectors which measures the absorbance of
				wavelengths in UV and Visible range. Each diode measures some specific
				wavelengths, and since there are many diodes (an array) we get a whole
				spectrum gathered with one measurement (as opposed to UV detector which
				measures only 1 wavelength at a time).
			</p>
			<p id="total-chromatogram">
				<b>Total Chromatogram</b> aka <i>TIC</i> (Total Ion Chromatogram) in
				Mass Spec, <i>TWC</i> (Total Wave Chromatogram) in
				<a href="#dad">DAD</a>. As opposed to
				<a href="#extracted-chromatogram">Extracted Chromatogram</a>.
			</p>
			<p id="extracted-chromatogram">
				<b>Extracted Chromatogram</b> - in Mass Spec it's an EIC (Extracted Ion
				Chromatogram), in DAD it's a chromatogram with some particular
				wavelength. As opposed to
				<a href="#total-chromatogram">Total Chromatogram</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>EMW</b> (exact molecular weight) - the molecular weight of the
				primary isotope of a compound.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mass Spectrometry types, modes and data processing:
				<a href="../article/mass-spec.html"
					>ScanMode, SIM, TOF, QTOF, Quadrupole, SQD, SRM, Product Ion Scan,
					etc.</a
				>
			</p>
			<p id="injection">
				<b>Injection</b> - represents data (spectra, chromatograms) with all
				detector measurements for the injected aliquot. Note that it's not the
				same as <a href="#sample">Sample</a> - which can be injected multiple
				times.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>MISER</b> (Multiple Injections in a Single Experimental Run) - is a
				way to leverage Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) of analytical instruments.
				Typical workflow is injecting a sample, then washing, then injecting
				again. In MISER runs you inject, then inject again without washing. In
				the end you wind up with a single long chromatogram for many injections.
				This may not be as clean (because column could be dirtied), but it's a
				way of speeding up analysis. Peaksel will split MISER chromatogram into
				many different injections and will report values for each of them
				separately to simplify further data analysis.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>LargestPeak</b> - peak with maximum area count among the peaks of the
				same substance on the same chromatogram.
			</p>
			<p><b>MF</b> - Molecular Formula</p>
			<p id="sample">
				<b>Sample</b> - a mixture or a pure compound that needs to be analyzed.
				Sample sample can be injected multiple times resulting in multiple
				<a href="#injection">Injections</a>, so these are not synonyms.
