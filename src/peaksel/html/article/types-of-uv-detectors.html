        <div id="toc"></div>

        <h2>UV Detector</h2>
        <p>
          This is the simplest of the detectors as it only measures one wavelength that the scientist configures
          using the software. It's confusing because DAD and MWD also measure UV absorbance, but when saying
          <i>UV detector</i> people <i>usually</i> mean exactly the fact that it can work with just a single wavelength.
        </p>
        <p>
          This detector <i>first</i> filters out the right wavelength, <i>then</i> it directs the light
          to the sample. Since the light that passes through the sample is of just one wavelength, it's called
          monochromatic light.</p>

        <h2>Variable Wavelength Detector (VWD)</h2>
        <p>This is an improvement over the UV detector that allows switching between the measured wavelengths. So
          the detector does the measurement, then some mechanical motor changes an angle to another wavelength
          and makes another measurement.
        </p>
        <p>So the key difference between the UV detector and VWD is you either get a single chromatogram or you can
          get multiple.</p>

        <h2>Diode arrays (DAD & PDA)</h2>
        <p>
          Diode array detector and Photodiode detector are 2 different names that mean the same thing. Instead of
          measuring just a single wavelength, they measure the whole spectra. E.g. they could measure light absorbance
          at 200 to 400 nm - all <i>at the same time</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As opposed to the UV detector, the light of broad spectrum is directed through the sample. The sample
          absorbs different wavelengths differently. After the light passed through the sample, the ray is divided
          into many monochromatic rays - each falling on its own mini-detector (photodiode). There could be many
          photodiodes (e.g. 1024) which allows to measure many wavelengths at the same time.
        </p>

        <h2>MWD & SWD</h2>
        <p>
          MWD (Multiple wavelengths detector) and SWD (Single wavelength detector) are actually the same as DAD/PDA
          detectors. But while the physical device is the same, vendors can
          restrict how many wavelengths are recorded at the firmware/software level. This is probably done for
          marketing/sales reason and doesn't have anything to do with the science.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while the device is just a DAD, what users get as a result is more similar to UV detector: it's just
          instead of just one measurement/chromatogram they get multiple (e.g. 8).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's some weirdness. If MWD/SWD is just a DAD that doesn't give the result from selected diodes,
          why some (many? all?) MWD/SWD associate the signal with <i>different retention times</i>? It seems like
          the detector measures one wavelength, then switches to measuring the next one. While that shouldn't be
          the case with the diodes - we can measure both of them at the same time.
        </p>

        <h2>Similarities to Mass Spectrometry</h2>
        <p>
          We can draw parallels between the data produced by these detectors. UV and VWD detectors are similar to
          the <a href="mass-spec.html#sim">Single Ion Monitoring (SIM)</a> done in Mass Spec. While DAD/PDA
          detectors are similar to <a href="mass-spec.html#scanmode">Scan Mode</a>. There doesn't seem to be any
          equivalent of MWD thought, but that's a weird concept in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>Chromatogram names in Peaksel</h2>
        <p>
          Since at the basic level all these detectors give us UV absorbance,
          <a href="https://elsci.io/peaksel">Peaksel</a> always refers to the signal from any of these detectors as UV.
          So we end up with chromatograms like <code>UV Total</code> (aka TWC, total wavelength chromatogram) and
          <code>UV xxx</code> for extracted chromatograms
          (see <a href="wl-extraction.html">DAD/PDA: Extracted and Reference wavelengths</a>).
