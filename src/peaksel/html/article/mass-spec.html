						<h2>Components of Mass Spectrometers</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Mass Analyzer</b> - the part which separates/sorts the ions. This
							determines the type of mass spectrometer e.g. Quadrupoles,
							Time-of-Flights, Orbitraps - they all differ in mass analyzers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Ion Source</b> is responsible for ionizing the analytes. The most
							used ion source in mass spectrometry is ESI (electro-spray
							ionization). Some of the sources are used only with specific Mass
							Analyzers: for instance MALDI (matrix-assisted laser
							desorption/ionization) is specific to <a href="#tof">TOF</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Detector</b> is the part that senses the ions that were passed by
							Mass Analyzer. Some of the detectors are coupled with Mass Analyzers
							- e.g. Orbitrap is both a Mass Analyzer and a Detector. Note Mass
							Spectrometer itself may also be called a "detector" when considered
							as a whole.

						<h2>Mass Analyzers</h2>
	
						<h3 id="quad">Quadrupoles, SQD</h3>
						<p>
							Quadrupoles (Single Quadrupole Detector in particular) are
							low-resolution mass analyzers. There are 2 sets of rods: one pair is
							on horizontal and one pair - on vertical axis. Voltages is applied
							to both pairs. It changes with different frequency so that one of
							the axes resonates with ions of m/z bigger than the one we're
							interested in, the other axis filters out ions of smaller m/z. Thus
							only the ions of the right m/z are passed through, while the rest
							are filtered out:
						</p>
						<img class="mass-spec__img--right"
							src="../img/article/mass-spec-quads.png"/>
						<p>
							When in <a href="#scanmode">Scan mode</a> - the m/z of interest
							changes gradually from lower to the upper boundary, measuring this
							way different ions at different time. When in
							<a href="#sim">SIM mode</a> - only one m/z is passed and the rest of
							them are filtered out; though it's possible to set up quadrupoles to
							switch between multiple specific masses.
						</p>
						<p>
							Quadrupole can also work in so called RF-only mode (RF - radio
							frequency). In this case it doesn't filter out any ions - all of the
							masses are passed through. This may be useful if quadrupole is used
							for other purposes than analyzing masses: e.g. as a collision cell
							or an as an interface before other mass analyzers.
						</p>
	
						<h3 id="tof" >TOF (Time-of-Flight)</h3>
						<p>
							TOF is a particle accelerator which then measures how quickly the
							analytes reach the detector. Small ions reach the detector faster
							than the big ions. By measuring time of arrival we can tell the mass
							of the arrived particle. TOF is considered a High Resolution Mass
							Spectrometer (HRMS) - it can tell apart ions with very small
							differences in mass compared to Quadrupoles.
						</p>
						<img src="../img/article/mass-spec-tof.png"/>
						<p>
							Because TOF is an HRMS it requires special care to designing its
							parts. In rest state ions don't actually stay still - they move
							around with different velocity according to

							>. Because of how sensitive TOF is - these initial differences in
							ions will have an impact on the eventual mass resolution:
						</p>
						<img class="mass-spec__img--vertical" src="../img/article/mass-spec-tof-ionpulser.png"/>
						<p>
							This puts constraints on how ion source is designed - you can't just
							trap ions after ESI because they will have large differences in
							initial kinetic energy. For these reasons other types of ionization
							is used.
						</p>
						<h4>MALDI</h4>
						<p>
							MALDI represents a plate with dried down sample - the laser is used
							to ionize the analytes in this case. This, along with

							keeps the ions close together and improves the resolution of the
							instrument. Such combination of components is called MALDI-TOF or
							MTOF.
						</p>
						<p>
							Nice thing about MALDI is it allows for High-Throughput Analysis -
							several seconds is enough to analyze hundreds of samples. But the
							drawbacks - it's not compatible with chromatography. So in the end
							you end up with just 1 spectrum instead of a chromatogram. This
							makes it impractical for most samples in pharma as this leads to ion
							suppression - which decreases sensitivity of the instrument.
						</p>
	
						<h4>oa-TOF</h4>
						<p>
							Orthogonal Acceleration TOF allows more diverse ion sources. E.g. in
							case of a hybrid of like Quadrupole-TOF (QTOF) this enables
							combining chromatography with TOF. In this scenario Quadrupole
							ensures the ions are focused in space. Then they get introduced in
							TOF ion accelerator, reflected via orthogonal accelerator and then
							continue as usual TOF:
						</p>
						<img src="../img/article/mass-spec-qtof.png"/>
	
						<h2 id="tandem">MS/MS, MS<sup>2</sup>, MS<sup>n</sup></h2>
						<p>
							Tandem MS means there are more than 1 mass analyzer separated either
							in space (there are 2+ physical devices) or separated in time
							(analytes go in circles and are processed by the same set of devices
							multiple times).
						</p>
	
						<h3>QqQ - Triple Quadrupole MS</h3>
						<p>
							This is a type of Tandem MS which has 2 quadrupole mass analyzers
							and yet another quadrupole in between which passes all ions through:
						</p>
						<img src="../img/article/mass-spec-quads-tripple.png"/>
	
						<h2>Modes of Mass Spectrometers</h2>
						<h3 id="scanmode">Scan Mode</h3>
						<p>
							Determines the presence of analytes in the range of m/z. E.g. we
							could scan from 100m/z to 1000m/z - all ions in this range will be
							determine. Some mass analyzers like quadrupoles will sequentially
							look for 100m/z, then go to 101m/z and so on till the end of range.
							Of course the granularity of the scan will be specific to a
							particular instrument and its settings.
						</p>
						<p>
							This mode is used when we need qualitative information about our
							sample - which m/z are present. It could also be used for
							quantitative experiments, but because it dwells on a single m/z for
							a very short period of time it's not as sensitive as
							<a href="#sim">SIM</a> mode.
						</p>
	
						<h3 id="sim">SIM - Single Ion Monitoring</h3>
						<p>
							Unlike <a href="#scanmode">Scan Mode</a> when scientists set up Mass
							Spectrometer in SIM mode they already know which m/z to look for.
							The instrument will look for the specified m/z instead scanning
							through all possible values - this allows the detector to dwell on
							configured m/z longer, reducing signal-to-noise ratio and allowing
							for better quantification.
						</p>
	
						<h3>Tandem MS modes</h3>
						<p>
							Most of the workflows use 2 mass analyzers and a collision cell in
							between. Mass analyzers could work either in SIM or in Scan modes
							depending on the specific need. Ions flowing out of the 1st Mass
							Analyzer are called Precursors (aka parent ion). Fragment ions
							coming out of the collision cell are called Product Ions (aka
							daughter ion).
						</p>
						<p id="cid">
							Collision Cell is used for Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) - in
							order to fragment the ions. This is important because it allows to
							receive a qualitative information about the precursor (whether it's
							actually our ion or something else with similar m/z), or to
							distinguish 2 isobaric precursors during quantification.
						</p>
	
						<h4 id="productscan">Product Ion Scan</h4>
						<p>
							Is about analyzing the fragmentation patterns of the selected
							precursor ion. Often is done before going to
							<a href="#srm">SRM</a> to understand which of the fragments are
							possible, how they differ from fragments of other precursors and
							which fragment gives the highest signal intensity (for further
							quantification).
						</p>
						<img src="../img/article/mass-spec-productscan.png"/>
						<p>
							Since 2nd mass analyzer works in
							<a href="#scanmode">Scan Mode</a> we get a whole spectrum of m/z
							every N millisec, but for each of the spectrum we also record the
							precursor m/z.
						</p>
	
						<h4 id="srm">SRM - Selected Reaction Monitoring</h4>
						<p>
							Also known as MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) - a mode when both
							of the mass analyzers work in SIM mode. Important for quantification
							of an analyte in a complex mixture. The 1st detector needs to be in
							SIM mode because multiple different precursors could potentially be
							dissociated into same fragments. Also there could be isobaric
							species either in the original mixture or in the fragments from
							different precursors.
						</p>
						<img src="../img/article/mass-spec-srm.png"/>
	
						<h4>Data-dependent acquisition (DDA)</h4>
						<p>
							Before selecting ion transitions for SRM we need to determine the
							precursor ions and the fragments they are split into. It's possible
							to first run a Scan, then for each of the ion we're interested in,
							we can run additional Product Ion Scan. But this is very time
							consuming. DDA solves this problem by allowing you to run a typical
							SQD Scan Mode and once high intensities of m/z are detected -
							automatically switch into another mode (e.g. Product Ion Scan).
						</p>
						<p>
							This allows for a much faster method development. E.g. if you're
							looking for 3 precursors - you'd have to run a Scan Mode and 3
							Product Ion Scans to gather all the necessary information for the
							future SRMs. With DDA it's just a single run. Once a high level of
							signal is reached - the instrument will check all high m/z's
							detected.
						</p>
	
						<h2>Types of chromatograms in Peaksel</h2>
