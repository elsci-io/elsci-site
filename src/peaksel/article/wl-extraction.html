			<h1>DAD/PDA: Extracted and Reference wavelengths</h1>
			<div id="toc"></div>
			<p>
				If you gather full DAD/PDA spectra, then instead of extracting a
				wavelength during acquisition, you can do this digitally offline. Unless
				you’re standing next to the instrument and want to know peak shapes
				right away, there’s little value (and may be some harm) in extracting
				wavelengths right in the acquisition CDS. You can always do this offline
				after all spectra are gathered.
			</p>

			<h2>Problems with online wavelength extraction</h2>
			<p>
				First, the way your instrument sets up wavelength extraction isn’t
				obvious. From Waters and Agilent documentation it’s not clear if they
				acquire requested wavelength separately. Meaning, does DAD switch
				between gathering full-spectra and selected-wavelength? Or maybe it
				keeps acquiring the spectra and simply extracts the chromatogram
				afterwards in the software? If it’s the former, then extracting
				digitally afterwards will give slightly different values. Which is
				probably not a big deal, but it’s not perfect either.
			</p>
			<p>
				A bigger problem with this is that when reading files by offline
				processing software, you don’t know if it displays whatever was
				acquired. And if that software does display the original trace, the
				results may differ if you do this again in the offline software. Because
				integration algorithms can be different between 2 software. For this
				reason if spectra are available, Peaksel will discard the original
				traces and will re-extract it itself. This way we ensure all
				chromatograms are extracted the same way and guarantee some consistency.
			</p>

			<h2>Reference wavelength - how does it work?</h2>
			<p>
				If you use a gradient elution, you may end up with a baseline drift. To
				compensate for this some scientists use a Reference Wavelength. The
				thinking is:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If changing solvent composition has a global impact on all wavelengths
					(e.g. due to changes in refractive index), then it adds/subtracts xAU
					both at <code>254nm</code> as well as at <code>300nm</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Therefore if we subtract whatever the signal is at
					<code>300nm</code> from <code>254nm</code>, we correct for the drift
					and end up with a straight baseline.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				There are problems with this thinking though: what if at some point a
				substance is eluted that absorbs at 300nm? Then by subtracting
				<code>300nm</code> from <code>254nm</code> we get an unjustifiable
				signal reduction. This is one of the reasons you may have dips on UV
				chromatograms. But if there’s no clear dip - you may just get a smaller
				peak area. So the data will lie and you wouldn’t know it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let’s say you extract a <code>254nm - 300±50nm</code> and discard
				spectra. Without the original spectra, how do you check if there weren’t
				true absorptions at <code>300nm</code>? This is a reason you can’t
				discard spectra in case you subtract a Reference Wavelength. Or at least
				you should extract Reference Wavelength as a separate trace - in
				addition to the wavelength of interest.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, suppose there’s a range of wavelengths that aren’t
				absorbed by any substance. So you can subtract it. But how do you know
				that range? You’ll first have to extract Reference Wavelength to ensure
				there are no peaks. Would you want to do 2 injections then? Probably
				not.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are the reasons it doesn't make sense to subtract online and
				always prefer post-processing. See also

			<h2>How Peaksel extracts UV chromatograms</h2>
			<p>
				Suppose you want to extract a <code>254±4nm</code>, what Peaksel will do
				is:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Sum intensities of all wavelengths between <code>250nm</code> and
					<code>258nm</code>. Note, that other software may
					<i>integrate area</i> (instead of summing) in the range instead.
				</li>
				<li>
					And divide by the number of points summed to get an average. So if
					your instrument gathered 250, 251, …, 258 nm, then Peaksel will divide
					by 9.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Why averaging? In general the reason you specify
				<code>254±4</code> instead of just <code>254nm</code>
				is because you want to reduce noise. Since any measured signal always
				has random noise, sometimes we get a little bigger signal than the true
				value, sometimes we get a little smaller value. So by summing multiple
				values we cancel it out. Then we calculate the average to give an
				approximation to whatever was at
				<code>254nm</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Averaging also means that we most likely will have a lower signal. So
				the wider the bandwidth, the smaller the peaks get. This is because your
				λ<small>max</small> is usually the apex of the peak on a spectrum and
				the rest of the points are located lower. Well, unless there's an
				overlap with another spectral peak and a shoulder is formed. But in that
				case you're better off selecting a different wavelength anyway.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the <code>Total</code> (aka TWC) signal is different. This one
				is just a summation without averaging. So they can’t be compared.
			</p>

			<h2>How Peaksel subtracts Reference Wavelength</h2>
			<p>A chromatogram <code>254±4 - 300±50</code> is calculated this way:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Get an average extracted wavelength at <code>254±4</code></li>
				<li>
					Get an average of the Reference Wavelength at <code>300±50nm</code>
				</li>
				<li>Subtract 2nd from the 1st</li>
			</ol>
