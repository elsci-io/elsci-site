							<p>
								Looking for sponsors to add a capability for NMR processing to the existing tool that already
								handles HPLC. The intention is to have a single tool or an interconnected suite of tools to cover
							  different analytical techniques.
							<p>We build high-quality, user-friendly apps. If you want to get a taste of how the end result will
								look, you can check out <a href="./peaksel">Peaksel</a> which already covers the HPLC workflows.</p>
							<p>If you're interested in sponsoring or want to be notified about the progress,
								let us know at <a href="mailto:support@elsci.io">support@elsci.io</a>.
								Here's our <a href="./business-model.html">Business Model</a>.
