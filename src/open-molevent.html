							<p>You probably have to frequently deal with a lot of open databases. Imagine a single website
								where the information from all those databases is aggregated. We have a good understanding of how to
								make it possible.</p>
							<p>
								We're looking for companies who're willing to sponsor development of such database. We already have some
								capabilities implemented as part of our <a href="./molevent">Molevent</a>, but a lot of work is
								still needed. There are 2 parts to it:
							</p>
							<ol class="business-model__list">
								<li>It's going to be a huge database, so we need to implement a technical possibility to handle that
									many records.</li>
								<li>And we need to write ETLs that would gather information from other sources.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>If you're interested in sponsoring or want to be notified about the progress,
								let us know at <a href="mailto:support@elsci.io">support@elsci.io</a>.
