							<p>We're happy to collaborate with external partners to distribute our software. There are 2 schemes
								that we support, though we're ready to consider other approaches.</p>
							<h2>Sales commission</h2>
							<p>This scheme assumes that you find a client who agrees to buy a license, and you help us demo the
								products and guide the client. As a reward you receive a % out of the deal, and that's the end of our
								transaction with you.</p>

							<h2>Client support premium</h2>
							<p>If you want to take a step further and "keep the client to yourself", you can sell them the
								licenses on your own at whatever price you see fit. You receive the reward from the client, and
								then you buy the license from us at the regular price. The client can keep contacting you for
								help and support, and each year you can keep the transactions going through you.</p>
							<p>This schema means you take on more responsibilities, and you'd have to learn the apps that you sell
								to be able to answer the clients' questions. We'll provide the materials and occasional tech sessions
								so that you're up-to-date with the new feature set and other changes.</p>
