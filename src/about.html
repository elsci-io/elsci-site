										One commonality that we noticed while working with
										pharmaceutical companies is frustration about software. While
										in theory scientists are people who dedicate their lives to
										pushing humanity forward, in practice they spend most of their
										time working around issues introduced by poorly written
										programs.

										We think that this is a natural consequence of the complexity
										of the field - not many software experts agree to spend years
										studying science in addition to programming. Thus we end up
										with software written by scientists out of frustration or by
										developers who don't really understand what they are doing.

										Well, we are those experts - we are a team of software

										Software that removes obstacles and lets you concentrate on
