						<section class="business-model__section">
							<p>We have a lot of experience building HTE platforms for big pharma. Our previous work turned into
								a very successful product that led to democratization of HTE across multiple sites: ~200 medicinal
								chemists doing HTE for their projects. It's time to build something commercial, off-the-shelf -
								something that other companies can enjoy.</p>
							<p>The platform can/will include a design phase:</p>
							<ol class="business-model__list">
								<li>Setting up generic reaction scheme, enumerating combinations of products</li>
								<li>Defining conditions (for condition screening experiments): setting up stoichiometries and reagent combinations</li>
								<li>Setting up controls</li>
								<li>Defining and optimizing plate layouts</li>
							</ol>
							<p>An execution phase:</p>
							<ol class="business-model__list">
								<li>Calculating the amounts and forms to order. And actually placing the order.</li>
								<li>Uploading and matching the procured compounds to with the design</li>
								<li>Fixing potential procurement problems with the order of vials and the missing/insufficient amounts</li>
								<li>Generation of worklists for the preparation of Stock Solutions, Source Plates and for the actual Reaction mixtures</li>
							</ol>
							<p>And a post-synthesis phase:</p>
							<ol class="business-model__list">
								<li>Reformatting of the plates for the subsequent analysis</li>
								<li>Storing the analytical results, matching them with the reactions to select best reaction conditions</li>
								<li>Purification of the products for prep workflows</li>
								<li>Support for the direct-to-biology workflow</li>
								<li>Creating scale up experiments from the initial screens</li>
								<li>Providing the data the future machine learning</li>
							</ol>
							<p>We build high-quality, user-friendly apps. If you want to get a taste of how the end result will
								look, we can show you other systems that we have built.</p>
